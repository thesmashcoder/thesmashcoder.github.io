**Fearless execution. Systems that ship. Discipline that lasts.**

This repository powers the personal landing site for **Maurice Jordan (theSMASHcoder)** — a developer, systems architect, and personal coach focused on building practical systems and helping builders execute with clarity.

The site is intentionally lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain. It serves as a single entry point for people who want to understand how I think, how I build, and how to work with me.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Most problems are not caused by a lack of tools.  
They are caused by a lack of structure, clarity, and follow-through.

My approach is simple:

- Reduce complexity
- Design systems before writing code
- Ship the smallest valuable solution
- Document clearly so momentum continues
- Apply the same discipline to life, business, and technology

This mindset applies whether I’m building software, advising on systems, or coaching someone through a reset.

## 🔧 What This Site Represents

This is **not** a portfolio full of buzzwords.

It is:
- A signal of how I think
- A record of problems I solve
- A starting point for collaboration or coaching

You’ll find:
- Clear messaging
- Real-world problem framing
- A focus on execution over aesthetics

## 🧩 Tech Stack

This site is intentionally simple:

- HTML5
- CSS (custom, no framework dependency)
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts (Inter)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

No build tools. No frameworks. No unnecessary complexity.

The goal is clarity, speed, and longevity.

## 🧭 Direction Going Forward

This site evolves alongside my work.

The core principle will remain the same:
**build what matters, remove what doesn’t, and keep shipping.**
